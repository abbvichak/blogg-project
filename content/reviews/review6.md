# My Thoughts
## 5 out of 5 stars
Its my favorite game ever. There need to be more base building survival games with some story elements. It pushes your want to preserve yourself, pushing the boundaries which make you feel safe. Any creature could sneak up on you, scare you and kill you. You could lose your vehicle and some things you had on you. And yet you push on, to survive and understand, going deeper and deeper. I love it.

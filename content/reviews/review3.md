# My Thoughts
## 4 out of 5 stars
I have always liked Farming Simulator games. These are so relaxing. You don't have to rush or think too much. Play couple of minutes or spent hours, it's up to you. Many possibilities to modify your farm or equipments. Take easy or hard challenge. Several fine maps to play. And it's evolving every day thank's to ModHub and active community.

It can't be total realistic but it's a game. You still can learn to grow and harvest and even use several equipment, which you has no opportunity in real world. In game you realize how hard and long way our food takes before it is on the table.

A really good game that gives you them Star Wars vibes. From the Clones vs Droids to First Order vs Resistance. Playing as the Heroes of Villains of Star Wars that actually feel more than some hack-and-slash combat system. With Lightsabers clashing as you block and/or parry attacks all the mean while blasters drain combat stamina for the killing blow moment. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is not only a FPS but a balanced one too. No matter what level your class made be, with a bit of skill you can dominate the playing field.

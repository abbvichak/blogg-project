title: Minecraft
description: Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.

# My Thoughts
## 5 out of 5 Stars  
Imagine what Minecraft might be like if it had been made with pixel art sprites and released in the SNES era. That sums up the overall vibe of Terraria pretty well. It also explains why I just can't seem to tear myself away from the darned thing. This devious little indie sandbox title borrows so many ideas from Notch's game that it essentially is Minecraft in 2D, but it also beefs up the familiar gameplay in exciting ways. There's a lot more creepy crawly stuff to kill, and the staggering number of doodads you can MacGyver together into deadly weapons to slay them with is mouth-watering. Say what you will; there's some gnarly fun to be had in these uncharted depths.

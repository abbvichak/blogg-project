# My Thoughts
## 4 out of 5 stars
Amazing game.
Terraria is like Minecraft with a WAY longer progression. While Minecraft has 6 ores, Terraria has 21, many of which only become available after defeating certain bosses. Oh yeah, did I mention the bosses? There are about 20, and are central to game progression. Many drop special items used to craft new gear and advance. For instance, you could mine up Crimtane ore to make some gear, but you could instead fight the Brain of Chtulhu(a weak boss) to obtian large quantities of crimtane, as well as tissue samples that will be needed in some of the gear.

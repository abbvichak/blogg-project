title: Rocket League
description: Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.

# My Thoughts
## 3 out of 5 stars
Rocket League is one of the most surprisingly addicting video games that I have had the pleasure of playing in recent years. Funny thing, thoughâ€¦ I never in a million years thought that I would consider a game like this to be so good. I have never been one to enjoy sports-related games but this one is really fun.
